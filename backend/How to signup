Signup:
Here we create a new user thta can be a student (default), a teacher or an admin.
For student: you should provide the following information
{
    "username":"Student_02",
    "password": "123456",
    "passwordConfirm":"123456",
    "email":"student_02@hotmail.com",
    "roles":["student"],
    "labSubject":"LabPhys_02",
    "labGroupNumber":"02",
     "teoSubject":"TeoPhys_02",
    "teoGroupNumber":"02"
}

For teacher you should provide the following information
{
    "username":"Teacher_02",
    "password": "123456",
    "passwordConfirm":"123456",
    "email":"teacher_02@hotmail.com",
    "roles":["teacher"],
}

For admin you should provide the following information
{
    "username":"Admin",
    "password": "123456",
    "passwordConfirm":"123456",
    "email":"student_02@hotmail.com",
    "roles":["admin"],
}
Warning: for teacher or admin we can also have the next piece of info , but IT IS IGNORED

    "labSubject":"LabPhys_02",
    "labGroupNumber":"02",
     "teoSubject":"TeoPhys_02",
    "teoGroupNumber":"02"

That means that for teacher or admin registration we can also have either:
{
    "username":"Teacher_02",
    "password": "123456",
    "passwordConfirm":"123456",
    "email":"teacher_02@hotmail.com",
    "roles":["teacher"],
 "labSubject":"LabPhys_02",
    "labGroupNumber":"02",
     "teoSubject":"TeoPhys_02",
    "teoGroupNumber":"02"
}
or
{
    "username":"Admin",
    "password": "123456",
    "passwordConfirm":"123456",
    "email":"student_02@hotmail.com",
    "roles":["admin"],
 "labSubject":"LabPhys_02",
    "labGroupNumber":"02",
     "teoSubject":"TeoPhys_02",
    "teoGroupNumber":"02"
}
without having any problem.

Why to bother with all this?
0) To make easy the creation of a user other than student when using Postman. It is annoying to have to delete some fields all the time. However, from the frontend you should leave out them
1) When somebody signs up we do not know the type of user, it could be a student, a teacher of admin.
In case of a student we need not only create the student user but also  the student grades! and to that end  "labSubject", "labGroupNumber", "teoSubject" and "teoGroupNumber" it is required.
For a user other than student "labSubject", "labGroupNumber", "teoSubject" and "teoGroupNumber" is not required!.
2) In the database the fields "labSubject", "labGroupNumber", "teoSubject" and "teoGroupNumber" are not defined! They are just necessary to create the student grades.
In another words: Regardless of the type of user you have, the same information is used to create it. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SPECIFY THE ROLE: student, teacher or admin

Course
Here we create a new course (this task is done by the administer)
Info required:
{
    "teacher": "649861bf089fda9a0788f759",
    "subject":"TeoPhys_02",
    "groupNumber":"06"
}
The possible subjects are: 
TheoPhys_01 (Mechanics), 
TheoPhys_02 (Electromagnetism), 
TheoPhys_03 (Thermo and waves), 
LabPhys_01 (Lab ofMechanics), 
LabPhys_02 (Lab ofElectromagnetism), 
LabPhys_03 (Lab of Thermo and waves),
subject and groupNumber are of type string

The value of teacher is the _id of the teacher user in the mongodB database. It is clear that in order to create a course the user must be created first.
